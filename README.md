# Stereoscopic Image Prototype

1. npm install -> if you get errors in the next step run npm install again
2. npm run start -> this will start the webpack server on localhost port 8080
3. run a server with https. For example, ngrok: https://ngrok.com/ -> after registration locate your ngrok exe file and run ''./ngrok http 8080 --host-header="localhost:8080"''
